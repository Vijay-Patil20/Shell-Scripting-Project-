Title: auto_backup.sh: Automate Directory Backup and Compression
Description:
This script automates the process of backing up a directory and compressing it for secure storage. It simplifies regular backups, saving time and effort.
Installation:
1.	Copy the Script: Download or copy the auto_backup.sh script to a desired location on your system.
2.	Make Executable (Optional): If you plan to run the script directly from the command line, you'll need to make it executable. Open a terminal, navigate to the script's directory, and run:
Bash
chmod +x auto_backup.sh
Usage:
Bash
./auto_backup.sh SOURCE_DIR BACKUP_DIR
Arguments:
•	SOURCE_DIR: The full path to the directory you want to back up.
•	BACKUP_DIR: The full path to the directory where you want to store the compressed backup.
Examples:
Bash
./auto_backup.sh /home/user/documents /backups/documents.tar.gz
# Backs up the /home/user/documents directory and compresses it into documents.tar.gz inside the /backups directory.

./auto_backup.sh /var/www /backups/website.tar.gz
# Backs up the /var/www directory (assuming it contains website files) and compresses it into website.tar.gz inside the /backups directory.
Important Note:
•	The script creates a compressed backup file (.tar.gz format). Ensure the backup_dir has sufficient space to accommodate the compressed backup.
